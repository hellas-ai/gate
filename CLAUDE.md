# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Essential First Step

**READ docs/META.md FIRST** - This file contains critical instructions for how to work with this project's documentation-driven development approach. All contributors (human and AI) must follow the workflow described there.

## Project Summary

**Gate** is a peer-to-peer AI compute network providing secure, private access to distributed AI inference resources. Built in Rust with Iroh for P2P networking.

**Current Status**: Documentation-only phase - comprehensive design complete, no code exists yet.

## Documentation Structure

1. **docs/OVERVIEW.md** - What Gate is and business context
2. **docs/DESIGN.md** - Technical architecture and system design  
3. **docs/PLAN.md** - Implementation roadmap with concrete next steps

### For Code Agents:
- **docs/META.md** - **REQUIRED READING** - How to work with this project's documentation-driven development approach

## Development Preferences

**Minimal, Focused Implementation**: Only implement exactly what is requested. Do not add:
- Extra packages or dependencies not explicitly needed
- Platform-specific code unless required
- "Helpful" additions or conveniences not asked for
- Verbose comments or explanations unless requested

## Development Commands

See README.md for development setup and commands.

## Next Action

Follow docs/META.md workflow: Read docs in order, then start with first unchecked task in docs/PLAN.md.
