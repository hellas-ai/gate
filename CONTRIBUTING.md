# Running and testing
- We use nix to install development dependencies. When running commands, you need to use `nix develop` to ensure all toolchains, libraries, helpers etc are available.
- nix develop --command bash -c "make ci"

# Coding Guidelines

General guidelines:
- This is a production-grade codebase. No hacks, no shortcuts, no 'do this later'.
- This is a greenfield project. We want the highest-quality code possible, so if we need to refactor or change things, its better to do it sooner than later.
- Complexity is our enemy- we should strive to keep our codebase as simple as possible (but no simpler)
- We are free to change whatever we need in this project in order to achieve our goals

# Crate organisation
## Core Crate
This crate contains the core hellas data types, traits, etc.
- Needs to compile across wide range of platforms, including wasm32
- Any platform-specific dependencies (or stuff which doesn't compile for a target) MUST be feature-gated and disabled by default
- Feature-specific code (e.g tlsforward functionality) should NOT be added to this crate
- If at any point we find ourselves adding complexity, consider what we could refactor to make it better
- We should always leave codebase in a better state than we found it-
    - If we remove the last usage of a function argument, remove it from the function signature and fix callers
    - If we remove the last usage of a function/method- remove it

# Imports
- In general, there should never be more than two-levels of `::` nesting- e.g instead of using `std::sync::Arc<MyType..>`, add `use std::sync::Arc` and just use `Arc`.
- If we have a large number of imports from the same crate (common when loading e.g DTO types from client library):
    - Use wildcard imports (esp if upstream crate has a `::prelude` module):
        ```
        use some_client::types::*;
        fn accept(foo: FooType, bar: BarType) -> BazType;
        ```
    - Or module imports (should be used sparingly- `as ` should only be used when we have similarly-named type modules, to avoid confusion):
        ```
        use some_client_a::types as a_types;
        use some_client_b::types as b_types:
        fn convert(foo: a_types::Foo) -> b_types::Foo;
        ```
- If we need conditional dependencies (e,g for `wasm`, whatever platform):
    - Make a single conditional and put all the imports in it, don't make a new conditional for each import
- Put imports at the top of the file. We should not have import in e.g functions unless strictly necessary- ask my permission for this.

# Types
- We are very big of type safety. We should be using the type system as much as possible to help us.
- This means stuff like:
    - Deriving the `From/Into/TryInto/TryFrom` traits instead of custom conversion functions.
    - No "magic variables"- consts and strings etc should be defined at module level `const WHATEVER_NAME: &str = "whatever-thingy"`, if appropriate. if you later need to access them from a sibling crate or module, hoist them somewhere accessible by both.
    - Avoid unstructured data- we should perform ser/de at our system boundaries as soon as possible
    - Try to avoid `Option<>` as much as possible- lets think about whether we can refactor to remove ambiguity
    - Return structured errors, not Strings
- use e.g Url instead of &str or String to store URLs
- use e.g HeaderName/HeaderValue instead of &str or String
- use e.g http::headers::AUTHORIZATION instead of "authorization"

# Style / Formatting
- This repo runs *strict* formatting and clippy checks. Don't worry so much about formatting as we can run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Clippy has lots of lints for unidiomatic code, try to add code that complies with these. e.g:
    - don't use `format!("my var: {}", var)` when you could use `format!("my var: {var}")`
    - no match blocks where if/else would suffice
    - appropriate use of `default` `self` etc.
- Try to write concise, terse code when possible. I don't mean doing everything on one line with one-character variables and semicolons- just use your common sense. 
- When fixing clippy lints, do NOT do 'lazy fixes'; do NOT 'ignore' them, by e.g:
    - renaming variables to start with `_my_unused_var`- we should just remove the symbol altogether.
    - adding #[allow(whatever)] - unless there is really good reason- ask me for explicit permission to do this

# Logging / Tracing
We use the `tracing` crate throughout this repo.
- Be very sparing with what is logged and at what level- noisy/spammy logs are worse than clean ones. If a code path is expected, it shouldn't be higher level than debug.
- We use OLTP library to export traces from e.g http servers. We should make new spans when necessary
- We must pass along correlation ids, trace parents etc, if present. For cross-service tracing.
- Adding explicit `use tracing::{info, warn};` etc imports cause a lot of code churn- `macro_use` them in crate root and skip importing.

# Comments
- This is a production-grade codebase, and as such documentation is very important.
- However, too many noisy/spamming/useless comments are bad too. They get out of date and are WORSE than useless.
- Do NOT leave comments like this:
    - `identity: LocalIdentity,  // Store identity in handle` - this is obvious, just don't write it
    - `identity: self.identity.clone(),  // Use stored identity` - again
    - Totally useless: ```
        // Update state
        self.state_tx.send(TlsForwardState::Connecting)?;
      ```
    - Confusing- why is it telling us about auth middleware?!: ```
        /// Create the configuration routes
        pub fn router() -> axum::Router<AppState<MinimalState>> {
            axum::Router::new().route("/api/config", routing::get(get_config).put(update_config))
            // Note: auth middleware is applied when converting to the final router
        }
        ```
- If a comment IS necessary, put it in standard rustdoc syntax. Don't go overboard with stuff like examples, defaults
- When refactoring code, feel free to drive-by cleanup any examples of these comments you see.

# Dependencies
- Relying too much on external libraries has various downsides- it bloats the code, may introduce security issues, forces strange api
- However we also don't want to re-invent the wheel and write too much code ourselves, and re-implementing tricky stuff like encryption has its own security issues
- In short, just be smart about adding dependencies. If you do need to add one:
    - Consider if it should be added as a workspace dependency- if more than one crate needs it
    - Should some other crate be re-exporting the dependency? For example, all our http code should be in `http` crate- probably that should re-export e.g `reqwest`
    - Be aware of features- when adding a crate, first check the available features. Probably we want to turn off the default features and just enable the ones we want
    - When adding a dependency to Cargo.toml, use coarse versions- e.g `thiserror = "1.0"`, `tracing = "0.2"`
    - If we remove the last remaining usage of a dependency in a crate, make sure to remove it from dependencies

# Error Handling
- This is production code, we should not have panic!(), unimplemented!(), todo!() anywhere- always return a Result.
    - In library code (ie, shared code that is used in different contexts):
        - Define a crate-level error type, using `thiserror`
        - Avoid using `.map_err` wherever possible- use the `#[from]` helper in `thiserror`
    - In application code (ie, code invoked directly by user, `main.rs`, etc)
        - It's fine to use `anyhow`
        - Add context where appropriate so backtraces, error messages are useful
- Try to avoid `map_err()` wherever possible- this means not only using `From` but `Into`- for example:
    - If you are writing HTTP handlers, your functions may return something like `impl IntoResponse`. We should implement
    `IntoResponse` (e,g map errors, to http status codes, format as json, give description)
    - If you are writing Tauri commands and they expect Result<String, String>, implement `Into<String>` for our errors

# Visibility
- We should think carefully about the visibility of all the code we write. Overuse of `pub` makes the library API enormous
and brittle, not to mention slows compiling/linking.
- If code is strictly heirachical, we can avoid making anything `pub` other than top-level crate exports. If not, we can use
e.g `pub(crate)`

# When embarking on a task
- Read ALL relevant information BEFORE starting to code. This includes the planning stage as well as implementation itself.
- Do not 'wait until i need to' to read existing code, do it proactively
- If you are at all unsure about the interface you're using, search for documentation, online if neccesary.
- If the interface is not behaving as you expect, read the documentation and fully understand whats different to what you expected, don't just bash away

# TODOs, Refactoring
- If during the process of implementing or planning some task, you see some beneficial refactoring that could be done, but is unrelated to ask in hand:
    - write a paragraph item to docs/REFACTOR_TODOS.md
    - this file should be treated as append-only- do not e.g update tasks in-progress here, add completed tasks etc.
    - dont start working on this refactor unless you are explicitly told to.
